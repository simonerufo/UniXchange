i asked to chatgpt who are the possible stakeholders of our UniXChange system, this is his response:

In a university system that involves the exchange of money, notes, and books, the stakeholders typically include:

    Students: They are the primary recipients of education and the ones directly engaging in the exchange of money for tuition, notes, and books. They have a vested interest in the quality of education, affordability of materials, and ease of access to resources.

    Faculty and Staff: These individuals are responsible for teaching, research, administration, and support services within the university. They may have a stake in the efficiency of processes related to course materials and financial transactions.

    University Administration: This includes various administrative bodies such as the president, deans, registrars, and finance departments. They manage the overall operations of the university, including financial transactions, academic policies, and resource allocation.

    Bookstores and Publishers: Bookstores operating within or in partnership with the university, as well as publishers providing educational materials, are stakeholders. They have a vested interest in selling books and course materials to students.

    Parents and Guardians: Especially for dependent students, parents and guardians may be stakeholders as they often finance or support their education. They are concerned about the cost-effectiveness and quality of educational resources.

    Alumni: Alumni have a vested interest in the reputation and success of their alma mater. They may contribute financially or through other means to support the university and its current students.

    Government and Regulatory Bodies: Government agencies, both at the federal and state levels, may have a stake in ensuring the quality and accessibility of education. They may provide funding, accreditation, or regulatory oversight.

    Donors and Philanthropists: Individuals, corporations, or foundations that donate funds or resources to the university are stakeholders. They may have specific interests in how their contributions are utilized and may seek to support initiatives related to education and research.

    Community and Society: The broader community in which the university operates is also a stakeholder. Universities often contribute to the cultural, social, and economic development of their surrounding areas, and community members may have an interest in the university's activities and impact.

Each of these stakeholders plays a role in shaping and influencing the policies, practices, and priorities of the university system.
